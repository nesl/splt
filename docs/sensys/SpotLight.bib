  abstract = {This tutorial provides an overview of the basic theory of hidden Markov
	models (HMMs) as originated by L.E. Baum and T. Petrie (1966) and
	gives practical details on methods of implementation of the theory
	along with a description of selected applications of the theory to
	distinct problems in speech recognition. Results from a number of
	original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring
	the background required to pursue further this area of research.
	The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and
	shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is
	a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The
	theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing,
	and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems
	of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these
	problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied,
	including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described},
