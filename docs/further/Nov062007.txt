Human intertwined loop
	In a way to deploy
	- Less sensors with users
	- Less effort to carry and maintain
	- Even an on/off switch is annoying
	- Avoid any calibration stage(?)

	In a way to receive service
	- How to present information that help users notice their patterns
		* PDA/CellPhone : LCD Graph representation (In terms of resources, appliances, sources of resources, else?)
		* Laptop : On screen - via e-mail, application, or ?
	- How often?
		* real-time, daily-basis or on request
	- Way to give a feedback(Individual)
		* Suggestion for usesrs to reduce consumption
		* Indication of wasted/useful resource consumption
		* Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Yearly budget and current status
		* Other metric?

	- Way to give a feedback(Employer)
		* Who's the most energy/resource hungry pereson
		* Other metric, say productivity/resource access

Survey will be needed(Descent Survey Scheme needed as well)
	- How do people feel like
	- How much are people willing to use

Since we want to affect human behavior, we also need to point out how this information affects it.
