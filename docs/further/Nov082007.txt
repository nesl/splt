How to teach appliances/other resource source to know I'm using it.
	- Baseline - generic usage pattern + correlation threshold
	- explicit teaching (Button or so)
		*Pros : Good
		*Cons : Usability issue 
		*After several explicit teaching, it makes some correlation tables and smaller thresholding

		* Users are willing to do that if rewards are provided

Event Detection
	- Look at Sadaf's work
	- How to define event : What is consuming status?
	- Which sensing modality can detect it?
		* Currently it was relative location
