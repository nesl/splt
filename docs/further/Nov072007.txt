How does the system identify who's spending resource
	- It was location/relative location
	- What about accel/gyro/other sensing modality that indicate human's intension
	- What about vision sensor(Say sensory grammer)?
	- What about explicit notification(i.e. tagging/log in)?
	- Else?
How should policy be?
	- One idea : User definable preference(I'm willing to pay more, I'm willing to pay less)
		* System could hit balance among users if some of them are spending at the same time
		* Like LP/Least Square
	- Equally distributed(?)
	- First one is the one
