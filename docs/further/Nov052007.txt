What's motivations?
	Book "Consumer Behavior and Energy Conservation" by Martinus nijhoff Publishers
	- main argument : Conservation the cheapeast and the most promising way

What's the eventual goal of the problem?
	Individual level resource management or monitoring

What are research questions regarding this?
	What kind of resources we are interested in
	- Electricity, Water, Fuel, Paper, else?
	Where do we deploy this platform?
	- Home environment
	- Office environment
	- Public space
	- Mass transportation
	- Car?
	Where do we place sensors?
	- Power measurement : Place at each appliance or One device for all appliances(GaTech)
	- Water measurement : Pipeline(Non-intrusive or intrusive), or microphone to detect on/off status
	- Fuel : Car(OBD II), Gas(Pipeline)
	- Location information : Infrastructure
	- What other sensor information needed to infer resource consumption patter
		* Acceleration information 
		* Gyro
		* Else?
	How do we relate various sensing modalities?
	- Sensor fusion : Which sensor reading implies what?
	- What kind of information is needed to infer well?
	
	Where is the optimal place where we get sensor information?
	- Human behavior : Outside(Video, PIR, and others), Inside(Acceleration, Gyro, temperature of skin?)
	- Resource : On each appliance or inference from some other related information

In terms of platform:
        Get one of appliance monitoring kits from Georgia Tech
        Contact Leland, Berkeley to get some information regarding power monitoring MEMS device

        Water Monitoring device: 
        http://www.omega.com/prodinfo/ultrasonicflowmeters.html
        which makes use of dopper shift effect and is well fit to monitor wastewater.
        But it is not suitable for clean water because of its sensing
        modality. (It measures particles' speed in fluid.)

        Fuel monitoring: OBD II and fuel consumption


Relation to Carbon Foorprint:
        PEIR and cars' CO2 emission profile
        
        
Some other Works:
        Smart Kindergarden, Andrea's paper and dissertation
        Sensory Grammer


Groundtruth:
        How do we measure ground truth

Some other considerations:
        Economy of the system
        Usability issues.
