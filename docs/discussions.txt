Three major divisions in the project:
Each project member will be responsible for one portion.

-RFID
    -Try to get M1-A1 working
    -Start interfacing with the motes
    -Decide if human carries the reader or the tags
-Power measurement
    -Ensure can interface the unit with the motes, mainly check the UART compatibility
    -Purchase the unit
-Preemption
    -Start looking at the code that Simon has sent
    -After the two devices are working with the motes, decide if want to do device level preemption and how to do it


After a couple of weeks of work in this area, we will work on the algorithms of interfacing everything together.


-Decide how to the database structure will be used and stored on sensorbase
