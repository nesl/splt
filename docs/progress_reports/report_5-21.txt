RFID
Last week
- Started writing UART driver for RFID reader and still in progress

This week
- Complete writing UART driver for RFID reader

Gumstix and SOS-server
Last week
- For slogging data to the sensorbase, we use the Python interpreter. But, the base sensor node forwards the RFID and PowerMeasurement data in the sos message form. Therefore, we need to write a plugin module that grab sos messages and interpret them for the slogging module. So we started writing the plugin module. 

This week
- Complete the preliminary plugin module and conduct the deployment


Preemption
Last week:
- Finished the core of preemption needed for the project.

This week: 
- Start doing some debugging on it. There are some corner cases that need to be handled.

Base Station Backend:
This week:
- Will start writing a simple app for the base station to grab data from sensorbase and then to make sense of it.

Power Measurement
-----------------
Last week:
- Started slogging power consumption from lab printer into SensorBase
- Completed protocol specifics required to transition to a mote based system
- Constructed API and function details for SOS based receive side of UART

This week:
- Write receive side of SOS UART driver
- Write WUPro driver as SOS module
