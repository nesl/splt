Gumstix+Backend
Last Week
- Almost completed the implementation of back-end application
- First deployment that receives RFID TAG IDs and sends them to the sensorbase has been conducted under single-hop scenario.  
This week
- Do the last deployment and debug it

RFID
Last Week
- RFID motes has been completed so we can conduct the RFID mote deployment

This Week
- Deploy multiple RFID receivers and conduct the last deployment
- See the effects on the long-term deployment and debug the SOS module

PM/RFID
Last Week
- Implemented UART driver that reads raw bytes from RFID reader and PM
- Driver is designed for asynchronous communication. When a packet is
  received from the UART, the driver sends a packet to the application
module
- Interfaced mote with RFID reader and PM on UART1 successfully and received
  RFID scan messages and PM measurements across the wireless link
successfully.

Next Week
- Need hardware level debugging to find out why driver code crashes after a few
hours.
- Complete a deployment with two motes first
- Then change the code to use both UART0 and UART1 for the deployment
-
